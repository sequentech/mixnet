  <h1><a name="Introduction">Introduction</a></h1>

  <p>

    The original motivation of this project was to implement a complete
    <i>provably secure and practical</i> mix-net including all the
    needed subprotocols, e.g., distributed key generation, joint random
    coin-flipping, and various interactive proofs. In the end it turned
    out to be easier to implement a general protocol framework and view
    mix-nets as a special case. Below we focus on the general
    library.

  </p>
  <p>

    The library is implemented in Java, but it can optionally be built
    on top of native libraries for increased speed using
    our <a href="#Subprojects">subprojects</a>.

  </p>

  <p><small><a href="#">Back To Contents</a></small></p>

  <!-- ######################################################## -->

  <h1><a name="Goals">Goals</a></h1>

  <p>

    The main goals of this project are:

    <ul>

      <li> To show that it is possible to implement provably secure
	protocols in a practical way that allows simple reuse of
	subprotocols in other protocols.

      <li> To implement a complete provably secure and practical
	mix-net. Mix-nets are among the most complex protocols
	considered in cryptography. Thus, implementing a mix-net in a
	way that is faithful to cryptographic theory provides an
	interesting challenge.

    </ul>

    Naturally, we hope that our implementation will eventually be used
    in practice. We also hope that the implementation, alongside with
    the efforts of others, will raise awareness in the more practically
    oriented security fields that for some types of tasks cryptography
    has now evolved to a state where there are concrete protocols that
    are both <i>provably secure</i> and
    <i>practical</i>. Conversely, we hope to learn more about what is
    important in practice and what is not.

  <h1><a name="DesignCriteria">Design Criteria</a></h1>

  <p>

    Our main design criteria are the following:

    <ul>

      <li> <b>Realistic Adversarial Model.</b> Communication and the
	adversary should be modeled in a realistic way.

      <li> <b>Provably Secure.</b> Implemented protocols should be provably
	secure in their abstract form under standard computational
	assumptions.

      <li> <b>Verifiable.</b> The correctness of the implementations of the
	cryptographic algorithms and protocols should be easy to verify.
	
      <li> <b>Flexible and Efficient.</b> The library should be easy to use
	and extend while preserving security, and it should be sufficiently
	efficient to use in practice.
	
    </ul>

  </p>
  <p><small><a href="#">Back To Contents</a></small></p>

  <h3>Rationale</h3>

  <p>

    Many assumptions about communication and the adversary's power in
    the cryptographic literature are unrealistic. This is often used to
    investigate interesting extreme cases and to illustrate interesting
    phenomena, which is natural in any science. However, in the
    practical setting, we need to choose a model that is convincing, but
    still allows practical protocols to be constructed. Unless the user
    feels that the assumptions are sound, it does not matter if the
    protocol is provably secure.

  </p>
  <p>

    History indicates that unless we start with a provably secure
    protocol, then an implementation is unlikely to be
    secure. Standardized "cryptographically strong" hash functions,
    symmetric ciphers, and pseudo-random generators,
    e.g., <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-1">SHA</a>
    and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard">AES</a>
    can be used if the security proof goes through assuming only that
    they are secure in the standard model, e.g., one-way, pseudo-random,
    semantically secure etc, but we avoid protocols where such
    primitives are modeled as "ideal ciphers" or similar "random
    oracle"-like notions. In particular, all assumptions should be
    falsifiable. One may object that using such primitives goes against
    the idea of provable security, i.e., why allow such primitives, but
    not heuristically secure protocols? One answer is that the
    cryptographic community has much more experience in trying to break
    both the standard assumptions and the small number of standardized
    primitives. Furthermore, protocols involve interaction, which is not
    well understood even when used constructively. That said, our goal
    is to provide the alternative of <i>exclusively</i> using primitives
    that are provably secure under <i>standard</i> computational
    assumptions.

  </p>
  <p>

    Unfortunately, history also indicates that even if we start with a
    provably secure abstract protocol it is unlikely that it is secure,
    due to implementation errors. Although formal methods for verifying
    cryptographic protocols have evolved during the last decades, they
    are unable to deal even with modestly complex protocols. Thus, the
    best we can do at the moment is to write clear code that other
    people can read.

  </p>
  <p>

    If we can not easily verify the implementation, then we are in
    effect trusting the implementor, i.e., he could just as well run a
    single server and act as a trusted party. Note that here the
    multiparty computation setting is quite different from the classical
    setting of two or more mutually trusting parties that try to defend
    themselves from a malicious outsider. In the former case, it is only
    natural that one of the mutually trusting parties perform an
    implementation and it does not matter if this is easily verified,
    whereas in the second this is unacceptable.

  </p>
  <p>

    Unless the protocol is flexible, it is a poorly designed library,
    and it is unlikely to influence the way people think about and use
    cryptographic protocols. It is of course hard to quantify
    flexibility. Similarly, unless the implementation is sufficiently
    efficient, it is not going to be used. What <i>sufficiently
      efficient</i> means is application dependent.

  </p>
  <p>

    In the context of cryptographic protocols re-usability is not only a
    software engineering concern. Trust in a piece of software increases
    with time and more independent reviewers.

  </p>
  <p>

    One sometimes hears the claim that <em>software independence</em>
    makes easy verification unimportant. This is true in the sense that
    any software may be used to verify the <em>correctness</em> of an
    output. However, the code must still be reviewed to give trust
    in <em>secrecy/privacy</em> and <em>robustness</em> (or anonymity in
    the case of mix-nets).

  </p>


  <h3>Some Consequences</h3>

  <p>

    To allow the code to be verified it should be written in a high
    level language such as Java or some script language. The code should
    be exceptionally simple, structured, and well documented. The code
    should be general to allow easy reuse in different
    implementations. It should be possible to verify each subprotocol in
    isolation.

  </p>
  <p>

    Any optimizations should be done where they actually matter and only
    if they do matter. To quote Donald Knuth:

  </p>
  <p>

    <i>

      "We should forget about small efficiencies, say about 97% of the
      time: premature optimization is the root of all evil. Yet we
      should not pass up our opportunities in that critical 3%."

    </i>

  </p>
  <p>

    In security critical applications, this is even more true, since
    bugs may break security and bugs may even be included
    maliciously. Furthermore, implementations of cryptographic protocols
    typically consist mostly of book keeping and error handling code.

  <!-- ######################################################## -->

  <h1><a name="Status">Status of the Project</a></h1>

  <p>

    All existing code is structured, documented, and tested to a certain
    extent. A handful of time-critical functions have been implemented
    in C and assembler using
    the <a href="http://java.sun.com/javase/6/docs/technotes/guides/jni/spec/jniTOC.html">Java
      Native Interface (JNI)</a> to allow invokation from Java
    applications.

  </p>
  <p>

    The underlying native large integer functionality is derived
    from <a href="http://gmplib.org/">GNU Multiple Precision
    Arithmetic Library (GMP)</a> including some extensions
    from <a href="GMPMEE_WWW">GMP Modular Exponentiation Extension
    (GMPMEE)</a>. The Java wrapper classes are provided by the
    package <a href="JGMPMEE_WWW">Java GMPMEE (JGMPMEE)</a>. GMP,
    GMPMEE, and JGMPMEE are all licensed
    under <a href="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/lesser.html">GNU
    LGPL</a>. Please see their respective homepages for more
    information. We remark that the overhead of calling GMP through
    JNI is negligible in the context of modular exponentiation, which
    means that these functions execute essentially as fast as if the
    library itself was written in C or C++.

  </p>
  <p>

    Little in terms of additional optimization is done beyond sensible
    choices of subprotocols and some minor protocol development. Few
    persons have read the code so far. Thus, more testing, optimizing,
    and code review is vital for the library to mature.

  <p>

    There are also some components that may be viewed as missing or as
    optional features depending on personal taste. For a detailed list
    of known bugs, missing functionality, and possible extensions and
    optimizations, please see <a href="#Plans">future plans</a>.

  <h1><a name="Usage">Usage</a></h1>

  <p>

    Few parts of the library will be used directly by a user.

  </p>


  <h3>Using the Mix-Net</h3>

  <p>

    The mix-net has a simple command-line interface that allows the
    trustees to generate the parameters of an execution, generate a
    joint key, and then execute the mix-net on a list of input
    ciphertexts. Please read the <a href="vmn_index.html">user
    manual</a> for more information.

  </p>


  <h3>Generating Primitive Objects</h3>

  <p>

    The
    class <a href="api/verificatum/ui/gen/GeneratorTool.html">GeneratorTool</a>
    implements general functionality for generating objects useful in
    cryptography, e.g., randomly chosen modular groups, keys to
    cryptosystems or signature schemes, etc. The simplest way to make
    use of this class is to use the shell script
    wrapper <code>vog</code> provided with the installation.

  </p>
  <p>

    To enable <code>vog</code> to generate an instance of a
    class <code>MyClass</code>, all that is needed is an associated
    generator class named <code>MyClassGen</code>, which implements the
    interface <a href="api/verificatum/ui/gen/Generator.html">Generator</a>,
    and of course to indicate to <code>vog</code>
    where <code>MyClass</code> can be found.

  </p>
  <p>

    Recursive use of the command gives us a natural way to generate
    complex objects. For example, the Cramer-Shoup cryptosystem is
    defined over a group of prime order and employs a collision-free
    hashfunction. The tool can be used separately to generate the group
    and the hashfunction, and then again to generate Cramer-Shoup keys,
    using the generated group and hashfunction as input.

  </p>
  <p>

    To learn more about <code>vog</code>, invoke it as <code>vog
      -h</code> to get up-to-date usage information, or read the output
    of this command <a href="vog_usage.txt">here</a>.

  </p>


  <h3>InfoTool</h3>

  <p>

    Another general tool exposed to the user, but typically as a shell
    script wrapper, is the
    class <a href="api/verificatum/ui/info/InfoTool.html">InfoTool</a>.
    It implements functionality for generating initialization files for
    protocols. Each party taking part in the execution of a protocol
    holds two initialization files at the start of the execution: a
    protocol info file and a private info file. For more information,
    see
    the <a href="api/verificatum/ui/info/package-summary.html">verificatum.ui.info</a>
    package.

  </p>
  <p>

    The protocol info file is identical for all the parties. It contains
    all the public information on which all parties agree, i.e., IP
    addresses to all the parties, public signature keys of all parties,
    and security parameters and other parameters used in the protocol.

  </p>
  <p>

    The private info file of each party is distinct. It contains all the
    information that is secret or that is at least not needed by the
    other parties, i.e., secret signature keys and internal
    configuration parameters.

  </p>
  <p>

    Different protocols require different sets of parameters and for
    some parameters there are natural default values and for some there
    are
    not. <a href="api/verificatum/ui/info/InfoTool.html">InfoTool</a>
    gives a simple way to generate these files. To use the tool to
    generate info file for a given protocol, the
    interface <a href="api/verificatum/ui/info/InfoGenerator.html">InfoGenerator</a>
    must be suitably implemented. The tool can then be used as follows.

    <ol>

      <li> One party generates a stub of a protocol info file containing
	all the common parameters of the protocol on which all parties
	have agreed. This stub file is then given to all the parties

      <li> Each party then generates, using the stub file as input, a
	protocol info file and a private info file for itself, and
	shares the protocol info file with all the other parties.

      <li> Finally, each party merges the protocol info files of the
	different parties into a single global protocol info file.

      <li> This gives each party a joint protocol info file, and a
        private info file. The protocol info file contains all public
        parameters of the protocol execution, including the public
        keys of all parties.

    </ol>

    The natural way to use the tool is to use a protocol-specific shell
    script wrapper. An example of such a wrapper is <code>vmni</code>
    which comes with the installation as part of
    the <a href="vmn_index.html">El Gamal Mix-Net</a>.

    The Verificatum software uses <a href="http://www.gmplib.org">Gnu
    Multiprecision Library (GMP)</a> to speed up some operations,
    the <a href="GMPMEE_WWW">GMP Modular Exponentiation Extension</a>,
    which extends GMP with simultaneous exponentiation, fixed base
    exponentiation, and primality testing routines,
    and <a href="JGMPMEE_WWW">Java GMPMEE</a> for calling these
    routines directly from Java classes through
    Sun's <a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/guide/jni/spec/jniTOC.html">Java

  <h1><a name="Plans">Planned Development</a></h1>

  <p>

    Below we outline some of our plans for the library. This is an
    incomplete list and points are not necessarily listed in order of
    priority although we try to.

  </p>

  <h3>Write Proofs</h3>

  <p>

    Many of the implemented protocols are well known, but composition of
    protocols that are provably secure individually must be done
    carefully. Furthermore, some of the implemented protocols are new
    variants.

  </p>
  <p>

    Much in terms of definitions of security and proofs can be derived
    from the literature, but there are things that are done differently
    here. Thus, we intend to provide a full proof of security of the
    implemented mix-net as a whole.

  </p>


  <h3>Known Bugs</h3>

  <p>

    Any piece of software contains more or less bugs. We have not spent
    much time on testing, so most bugs are unknown at the moment. Thus,
    the modest list below is an indication of the need for further
    testing and not a measure of quality.

  </p>

  <ul>

    <li> Sometimes streams are not closed after usage which leads to
      leaking of file descriptors. Since there is an upper bound on
      the number of file descriptors, a protocol could halt due to
      this problem. A systematic verification that every opened stream
      is also closed must be done.

    <li> A call to newInstance, using Java reflection, may throw an
      exception that is never caught in ByteTreeConverter or
      HexConverter respectively.
      
  </ul>


  <h3>Missing Functionality</h3>

  <ul>
    
    <li> The bulletin board currently has no error handling at
      all. More precisely, if no message or a valid signature can be
      downloaded in time, the administrators are asked if they wish to
      have another go. If not, then the protocol halts without an
      input. This gives security, but without guaranteed delivery.

    <li>

      <p>

	Assuming that the bulletin board is perfect, one must still
        decide for how long each server wishes to wait to download a
        message and an upper bound on the number of bytes to
        download. The interface of verificatum.protocol.com.BullBoard
        is prepared for this, but the protocol code has not been
        updated to take advantage of it.

      </p>

      <p>
	
	The right approach is probably to use a default upper bound on
	time and byte count for most places and then carefully choose
	these numbers for the remaining places where there is a large
	computationally cost.

      </p>
      <p>

	We stress that this is not only a practical nuisance. If a
	server is deemed not to give an output, and this server is in
	fact honest, the assumption of an honest threshold number of
	parties may be violated.
	
      </p>

  </ul>

  <h3>Groups</h3>

  <ul>

    <li> Update <code>verificatum.arithm.ModPGroup</code> to allow
    choosing standard named parameters.

  </ul>


  <h3>Testing and Reviewing</h3>

  <ul>

    <li> There are unit tests for a few classes and a framework for
      running them, but they provide far from sufficient coverage.

    <li> The code as a whole must be reviewed by other people than the
      author(s).

  </ul> 


  <h3>Optimizations</h3>

  <ul>

    <li> If the Pedersen hashfunction is used instead of SHA-2, then its
      implementation should be optimized by using a fixed table for
      simultaneous exponentiation. This is fairly easy to do.

    <li> One could perhaps replace <code>java.io</code>
      by <code>java.nio</code> to improve the running time of IO. This
      seems unlikely to reduce the overall running time significantly,
      since IO is not a bottleneck.

    <li> When using file-based arrays, one could make the reading of a
      batch of elements concurrent with working on it. This should
      reduce the (small) overhead of using file-based arrays.
 
  </ul>

    <li><b>Is there a user group, mailing list, etc.?</b>

      <p>

	No. If one is needed, it will be created. Currently, there is no need.

      </p>


    <li><b>Java is so slow, why didn't you use C/C++/X? (replace X by your
	favourite much better programming language)</b>

      <p>

	For pure arithmetic code Java is slow, but most of the code in a
	cryptographic protocol consists of book-keeping code that does not
	influence the running time of the protocol much. We strongly believe
	that such code should be written in a high level typed language like
	Java to make the code simple and easy to verify. Java is one of the
	most well known high level languages, and run on all major platforms,
	which made our choice easy.

      </p>

	C and C++ are perfect vehicles to hide malicious code from humans. See
	<a href="http://underhanded.xcott.com/?p=8">The Underhanded C
	  Contest</a> for inspiration. The situation with Java is slightly
	better. That said, our library does allow mapping a few time critical

	Why didn't you use the (my own/well known) X command line parser
	library?</b>

      <p>

	We considered it, but decided against it to keep the library
	self-contained and simple. The mentioned libraries are in constant
	development and contain numerous things that we do not need, and we
	expect that most people outside the Java developer community are not
	interested in learning yet another tool or library.

      </p>


    <li><b>Why didn't you use the (my own/well known) X library for
	cryptographic primitives/protocols?</b>

      <p>

	Because we want the library to be self-contained and simple, i.e., the
	primitives should not have any "junk" from standards committees. In
	short, we wanted a clean slate to be able to focus on our
	goals. However, please <a href="mailto:VERIFICATUM_EMAIL">email us</a>
	if you think your library would be useful to us. We intend to retrofit
	additional functionality using wrappers and JNI. Please contact us
	before starting any new project in this direction, since other people
	may already be working on what you want.

      </p>


    <li><b>How fast is the library?</b>

      <p>

	It is difficult to fairly compare the complexity of cryptographic
	protocols. Partly because security parameters can be chosen in more or
	less conservative ways, but mostly because different cryptographic
	protocols have different and incomparable security properties and are
	based on incomparable assumptions that people agree with to a varying
	extent. It is often possible to get a faster protocol by considering a
	weaker attacker, or by using heuristic arguments such as the random
	oracle model. 

      </p>
      <p>

	As far as we know, no previous implementation of a provably secure
	mix-net <i>as a whole</i> exists. Thus, it is hard to
	compare. However, our license permits you to download the code and do
	any measurements you are interested in. If you do, then please
	<a href="mailto:VERIFICATUM_EMAIL">email us</a> a brief summary of your
	results and any comments you may have!

      </p>

    <li><b>Why didn't you implement a general homomorphic mix-net?</b>

      <p>

	At the start of the project this was considered. The obvious
	alternative to El Gamal would be the Paillier cryptosystem. However,
	although all homomorphic mix-nets are quite similar from an abstract
	point of view, implementations would in fact not share much
	code. Furthermore, El Gamal is more practical in distributed settings,
	since it does not require a jointly generated RSA modulus. Thus, in
	the interest of simplicity and verifiability we chose to focus on El
	Gamal based mix-nets. Another reason for avoiding Paillier is that it
	is patented.

      </p>
      <p>

	We are of course considering extending the protocol with various other
	protocols.

      </p>

    <li><b>Where can I find older versions of the library?</b>

      <p>
	You should not use an older version at all, since this library
	is not completely stable yet, so we have deliberately made it
	difficult to get hold of old versions. If you <em>really</em>
	want to get one of the old versions, then
	please <a href="mailto:VERIFICATUM_EMAIL">email us</a>.

  <h1><a name="Acknowledgements">Acknowledgments</a></h1>

  <p>

    Needless to say, my former supervisor Johan Håstad, and several
    other people have influenced my view of cryptography, and I am
    grateful to the researchers that have discovered some of the
    protocols I have implemented, but here I only acknowledge the
    specific help I have received on implementation issues.

  </p>
  <p>

    During recent years I have been fortunate to enjoy the programming
    expertise of Per Austrin, Torbjörn Granlund, Gunnar Kreitz, and
    Stefan Nilsson. They have patiently listened, often during lunch,
    to my thoughts and mundane "problems" and given valuable feedback.

  </p>
  <p>

    A precursor of this library, that was never completed and never
    made public, was an implementation of a heuristically secure
    mix-net that was developed in a project with Torsten Ekedahl,
    Björn Grönvall, and Gunnar Sjödin at
    the <a href="http://www.sics.se">Swedish Institute of Computer
    Science (SICS)</a>. The Verificatum library is differently
    structured from this precursor and share no code with it.

  </p>
  <p>

    From time to time I have also had discussions with international
    colleagues on more or less implementation specific issues. I am
    grateful to Ben Adida, Jun Furukawa, Jens Groth, Andy Neff, and Kazue
    Sako.
