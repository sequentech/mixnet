<p>

  Vfork is part of an ongoing research project at
  the <a href="http://www.csc.kth.se/tcs">Theory group</a> of
  the <a href="http://www.csc.kth.se">School of Computer Science and
  Communication</a> of the <a href="http://www.kth.se">Royal Institute
  of Technology</a>. The project is partly funded by
  the <a href="http://www.stratresearch.se">Swedish Foundation for
  Strategic Research</a> and the goal of the project is to implement
  an
  <b>easy-to-use, full-featured, free, open source, complete, fast,
  and provably secure mix-net.</b>

</p>
<p>

  The main author of the software is <a href="http://www.csc.kth.se/~dog">Douglas
  Wikstr&ouml;m</a>, but we are <a href="#cooperation">cooperating</a>
  with other research groups and developers. If you are interested in
  contributing to the project or simply plan to use it,
  then <a href="mailto:dog@csc.kth.se">email us</a>!</b>

<h1><a name="documentation"></a>Documentation</h1>

<p>

  <ul>

    <li> <b><a href="vmnum.pdf">User Manual for the Vfork
    Mix-Net.</a></b> This targets operators of the mix-net and assumes
    that Vfork has already been installed.

    <li> <b><a href="vmnv-0.1.pdf">How to
    Implement a Stand-alone Verifier for the Vfork
    Mix-Net.</a></b> The Vfork Mix-Net can optionally use the
    Fiat-Shamir heuristic to produce non-interactive zero-knowledge
    proofs of correctness. This document targets implementers of
    stand-alone verifiers of such proofs.

    <li> <b>Description and analysis of abstract protocol.</b> This
    document is still in preparation and targets cryptographers and
    other interested with some mathematical background. It will
    contain a complete self-contained description of the abstract
    protocol and an exact proof of security. A short bullet-list of
    the protocols we use can be found <a href="prot.html">here</a>

  </ul>

</p>

<h1><a name="verifiers"></a>Stand-alone Verifiers</h1>

<p>
  <ul>

    <li> <b>Built-in verifier.</b> Vfork has its own
    verifier <code>vmnv</code>. This is based on the same libraries as
    the mix-net itself, it is fast, and it can perform both the core
    verification and the overall verification for any mix-net
    interface and any set of parameters. But, it is also quite
    complex.

    <li> <a href="http://www.mixnet.org/pvmnv"><b>Python
    reference implementation of verifier.</b></a> This is a true
    stand-alone verifier implemented from scratch in Python without
    any external dependencies. The goal of the implementation is to be
    a simple as possible. Currently, it only handles modular groups,
    it is slow, and it only verifies the core of the universally
    verifiable proof.

    <li> More verifiers are currently implemented by other people and
    links will appear here when they are done.

  </ul>

<h1><a name="cooperation"></a>Cooperation</h1>

<ul>

  <li><b>University of Surrey</b>
    <p>

      We are pleased to announce that the University of Surrey's team
      on the <a href="http://www.tvsproject.org">Trustworthy Voting
      Systems</a> project, led by Dr James Heather and Prof. Steve
      Schneider, will be working with us to complete the Vfork
      implementation. The aim of the Trustworthy Voting Systems
      project is to produce a practical and scalable implementation of
      the <a href="http://www.pretavoter.com">Prêt à Voter</a> voting
      system, along with proofs that the system meets its security
      goals.

    </p>

  <li><b>Tel Aviv University and IDC Herzliya</b>
    <p>

      We are pleased to announce that the team behind
      the <a href="http://www.wombat-voting.com">Wombat voting</a>
      system led by Alon Rosen (IDC), Amnon Ta-shma (TAU), Ben Riva
      (TAU), and Jonathan (Yoni) Ben-Nun, have used Vfork to
      implement the underlying mix-net.

    </p>

  <li><b>Ágora Ciudadana</b>
    <p>

      The team behind
      the <a href="http://www.sequentciudadana.org">Ágora Ciudadana</a>
      project is working towards making Vfork scale to massive
      and frequent elections by allowing Vfork authorities to
      distribute the vote processing among multiple machines
      using <a href="http://hadoop.apache.org">Hadoop</a>. Eduardo
      Robles Elvira founder of <a href="http://www.wadobo.com">Wadobo
      SL</a> is leading this effort. Ágora Ciudadana is a project
      (started
      by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Party">Partido
      de Internet, PDI</a>) whose aim is to create a secure and
      scalable voting system with vote delegation support that can be
      used in a liquid democracy setup, where representatives act as
      mere proxy voters, voting in the representative chambers
      accordingly to what citizens previously voted over Internet.
