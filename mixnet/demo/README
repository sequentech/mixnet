       DEMO INSTRUCTIONS

The script run_all_demos run demonstrators for several
subprotocols. These subprotocols are meant to be invoked by a larger
protocol, which is why there are special demo classes that can be used
to invoke them. The demo class simply sets up the parameters needed
for the subprotocol to be executed.
