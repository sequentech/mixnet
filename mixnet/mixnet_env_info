A script named .mixnet_env has been generated, which attempts to
set all the necessary environment variables correctly. You probably
want to copy this file to your home directory and make sure the
appropriate init file sources this script. Using bash, this can be
done as follows:

    cp .mixnet_env ~/
    printf '\nsource ~/.mixnet_env' >> ~/.bashrc
    source ~/.mixnet_env

Now, every time you start a new bash-shell the environment is
hopefully set up correctly. You can check that you set up things
correctly by executing:

    ./checkinstall
