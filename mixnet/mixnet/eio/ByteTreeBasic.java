/**
 * This class is the base class of an intermediate byte oriented
 * format used for communication and storing data to file. Let us call
 * this format byte tree. In contrast to a raw byte array, a byte tree
 * has ordered tree structure. This simplifies parsing any one of the
 * numerous formats needed in other classes and allows performing
 * basic verification of an input. We use our own format and not the
 * {@link java.io.Serializable} class to avoid the overhead imposed by
 * this interface and to simplify writing a compatible implementation
 * in some other language.
 *
 * <p>
 *
 * A byte tree is defined as follows. A byte tree either holds data or
 * other byte trees. In the former case the data is simply stored as a
 * <code>byte[]</code>. In the latter case the instance holds an array
 * of byte trees, that may themselves either hold data or be byte
 * trees. A byte tree can be turned into an array of bytes using depth
 * first traversal. If a byte tree stores data, it is converted to a
 * byte array consisting of: a single byte (one) signalling that this
 * is a data-storing byte tree (a leaf), four bytes giving the number
 * of bytes of data (an int), and the actual data bytes. If a byte
 * tree stores other byte trees, then it is converted into a byte
 * array containing: a single byte (zero) saying that this is a
 * tree-storing byte tree (an inner node), four bytes storing the
 * number of byte trees (an int), and then recursively the byte arrays
 * of the child byte trees. Conversely, data on file can be recovered
 * from an array of bytes. A byte tree can of course be read/written
 * to/from a file without first explicitly converting it into/from an
 * array of bytes. This is needed to allow very large byte trees.
 *
 * <p>
 *
 * The implementation consists of the following classes.
 *
 * <ul>
 *
 * <li> ByteTreeBasic (this class): Provides basic writing
 * functionality and hashing functionality; partially in terms of
 * abstract methods.
 *
 * <li> {@link ByteTree}: Provides an in-memory implementation of a
 * handler of the format. This should be used to pack/unpack
 * reasonable amounts of data that fits comfortably in memory.
 *
 * <li> {@link ByteTreeF}: Provides a file based byte tree.
 *
 * <li> {@link ByteTreeContainer}: In protocols, the parties may need
 * to send structured data where some subtrees are fairly small and
 * thus most easily handled using <code>ByteTree</code> and others are
 * huge and handled by <code>ByteTreeLazy</code>. For the receiver
 * this is not a problem. He can read such data using
 * <code>ByteTreeF</code>. <code>ByteTreeContainer</code> provides the
 * needed functionality of the sender. Several
 * <code>ByteTreeBasic</code> instances can be combined. This
 * corresponds to structured data where some subtrees are stored on
 * file and some are in memory.
 *
 * <li> {@link ByteTreeReader}: Abstract class representing a reader
 * of byte trees
 *
 * <li> {@link ByteTreeReaderF}: Reader of {@link ByteTreeF}.
 *
 * <li> {@link ByteTreeReaderC}: Reader of {@link ByteTreeContainers}.
 *
 * <li> {@link ByteTreeReaderBT}: Reader of {@link ByteTree}.
 *
 * <li> {@link ByteTreeWriterF}: Writer of {@link ByteTree}
 * instance. This should only be used <em>inside</em> classes, e.g.,
 * in {@link LargeIntegerArrayF}.
 *
 * </ul>
