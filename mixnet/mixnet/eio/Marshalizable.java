/**
 * Interface capturing the ability of the instance of a class to be
 * marshalled into a byte tree with type information that can later be
 * restored to the instance. This is useful to, e.g., be able to
 * obliviously recover an instance of a subclass of {@link PGroup} of
 * the precise subclass.
 *
 * <p>
 *
 * <b>Convention.</b> For this to be possible we require by convention
 * that every class that implements this interface also implements a
 * static method with one of the following signatures:
 *
 * <p>
 *
 * <code>public static {@link Object} newInstance({@link ByteTreeReader} btr, {@link RandomSource} rs, int certainty)</code><br>
 * <code>public static {@link Object} newInstance({@link ByteTreeReader} btr)</code>
 *
 * <p>
 *
 * The first method allows probabilistically checking the input using
 * the given source of randomness. The error probability should be
 * bounded by <i>2<sup>-<code>certainty</code></sup></i>.
