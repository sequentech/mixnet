/**
 * Implements a coin-flipping protocol using Pedersen verifiable
 * secret sharing, i.e., each party verifiably shares a random value
 * over a ring. Then all random secrets are recovered and the random
 * coin is defined as the sum of these secrets. This is essentially a
 * wrapper class for {@link PedersenSequential} using the
 * exponentiated product map {@link BiExpProd}.
 *
 * <p>
 *
 * For efficiency, the (correct) secret sharings are added up in the
 * natural way into a single joint Pedersen sharing before
 * recovery. The result of the method {@link #prepareCoin(Log)} is
 * that each party shares a random value and the resulting shares are
 * added up locally at each party. Later, the user can call {@link
 * #getCoin(Log)} to actually get the random coin that was prepared.
