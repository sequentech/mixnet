<head>Demonstration</head>

This package gives a unified way to demonstrate cryptographic
protocols. The main things that distinguishes a demonstration from a
real execution are the following:

<ol>

<li> Each party is executed as a {@link java.lang.Runnable}. Thus, all
parties are simulated locally within a single JVM.

<li> The configuration files used by a party are typically generated
automatically, based on the options provided to the demonstrator.

</ol>

To demonstrate an existing protocol, the programmer must implement the
interface {@link mixnet.protocol.demo.DemoProtocolFactory}. This
interface allows {@link mixnet.protocol.demo.Demo} to set up and
execute a demonstration.
