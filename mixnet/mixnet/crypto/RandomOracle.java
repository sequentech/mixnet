/**
 * A "random oracle" which can be instantiated with a given length

 * using the underlying hashfunction. This gives a digest. The output
 * bytes are then derived by concatenating the result of repeatedly
 * evaluating the digest concatenated with an integer counter that is
 * initially set to zero and incremented by one inbetween calls. The
 * resulting output is then truncated to the correct byte length and
 * as many bits as needed in the first output byte are set to zero.
