                       VFORK (FULL)

This is a meta-package that builds and installs GMPMEE, JGMPMEE, and
Vfork. Please follow the instructions of vfork/README, but
execute the commands in this directory. This will install everything
you need.

Currently this ONLY WORKS FOR 64-bit platforms due to a bug in libtool
that performs incorrect relinking on 32-bit platforms. If you are on a
32-bit platform, then you should make and install each sub-package
separately and in the order GMPMEE, JGMPMEE, and Vfork.

Vfork is a fork of Verificatum. Verificatum AB
(http://verificatum.com) currently maintains a more updated, though
not libre software, version of verificatum. Currently, Agora Voting
maintains Vfork, which is a fork of the LGPL version of verificatum.
