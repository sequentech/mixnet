         GMP MODULAR EXPONENTIATION EXTENSION FOR JAVA

This package allows invoking GMP's modular exponentiation, including
the extension provided by the GMP Modular Exponentiation Extension
package (GMPMEE) for simultaneous or fixed base modular exponentiation
and primality testing, from within a Java application. This
drastically improves the speed of such operations compared to pure
Java implementations.

For details of simultaneous exponentiation, a good source is Handbook
of Applied Cryptography, Menezes, Oorshot, and Vanstone, which is
available for free at http://www.cacr.math.uwaterloo.ca/hac.


                      BUILDING

The source consists of both Java and C code. The Java source
essentially provides a wrapper of the functionality implemented in C
on top of GMP using Java Native Interface (JNI).

Building has only been tested with GMP 4.2.4 or later. You also need
to build and install the GMPMEE package (found at www.vfork.com)
before building this package. Then LIBRARY_PATH must point to
libgmp.la and libgmpmee.a and C_INCLUDE_PATH must point to gmp.h and
gmpmee.h. This is usually the case automatically after installing GMP
and GMPMEE.

The javah command also needs to find the header files (jni.h and
jni_md.h). The building scripts attempts to find these files
automatically, but if this fails you need to add their locations to
C_INCLUDE_PATH.

Then use

        shell> ./configure
        shell> make

to build the library. This also builds some rudimentary testing and
timing functionality, i.e., the classes jgmpmee.Test and jgmpmee.Time
respectively.


                      INSTALL

1) Use

        shell> make install

   to install the library libjgmpmee_JGMPMEE.{la,a,so} and the
   jar-file jgmpmee.jar in the standard locations. See INSTALL for
   details on other ways to invoke ./configure, e.g., to use a
   user-local installation.


2) You should also make sure that the newly installed jar-file is
   found by java by updating your CLASSPATH. You can use the following
   snippet in your init script.

       export CLASSPATH=/usr/local/share/java/jgmpmee.jar:${CLASSPATH}

3) You need to tell the JVM where your native library, i.e.,
   libjgmpmee.{la,a,so} can be found. You may either pass the location
   using the java.library.path property, e.g.,

        shell> java -Djava.library.path=/usr/local/lib/

   or you can set the shell variable LD_LIBRARY_PATH once and for all
   in an init file, e.g.,

        export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/lib:${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}

4) You can test if you managed to build, install, and set up JGMPMEE
   correctly now by executing:

        shell> java jgmpmee.Test

   You should get a usage description. Then you can run

        shell> java jgmpmee.Test -se 1000 1024

   to perform a test corresponding to 1000 modular exponentiations
   with a 1024-bit modulus and 1024-bit exponents.



                     API DOCUMENTATION

Finally, you may use
 
        shell> make doc

to build also some Javadoc-documentation. This is not installed
anywhere. It remains in your source directory, but you can of course
copy it to any location.



                           TIMING

You may compare a naive pure Java implementation to the one making
native calls using the class jgmpmee.Time. It works similarly to
jgmpmee.Test and can also be invoked without argument to get usage
information. It can for example be invoked as:

        shell> java jgmpmee.Time -e -j 1000 1024

or

        shell> java jgmpmee.Time -e -n 1000 1024

to compare the running time of modular exponentiation using
java.math.BigInteger with the running time of making native calls to
GMPs routines.



                        REPORTING BUGS

If you find a bug in the library, which does not originate within GNU MP
itself, please make sure to tell us about it!

Report bugs to dog@csc.kth.se, and please follow the advice provided
in the GNU MP for how to submit bugs.
