<h1><font size="+4">Mix-Net Protocol</font></h1>

<hr>

<p>

  We are currently working on a paper detailing both the mix-net and a
  self-contained proof of security of the particular variation of a
  reencryption mix-net that we have implemented, as well as a
  self-contained definition of universally verifiable proofs of
  correctness that are optionally produced as the result of an
  execution. For now, we only give a short bullet list of the
  protocols we use:

</p>
  <ul>

    <li><b>Joint key generation.</b> This is done by direct use of
      Feldman, <em>A practical scheme for non-interactive verifiable
      secret sharing</em>, 28th FOCS. (As explained in Gennaro,
      Jarecki, Krawczyk, Rabin, <em>Secure Distributed Key Generation
      for Discrete-Log Based Cryptosystems</em>, Journal of Cryptology
      2007, this gives a slightly biased key, but this works fine.)

    <li><b>Joint Coin-Flipping.</b> This is done by the standard
      share-and-recover protocol based on
      Pedersen, <em>Non-interactive and information-theoretic secure
      verifiable secret sharing</em>, Crypto '91.
      
    <li><b>Mix-net.</b> We use the reencryption mix-net approach
      introduced by Park, Itoh, and Kurosawa, <em>Efficient Anonymous
      Channel and All/Nothing Election Scheme</em>, Eurocrypt '93, but
      our own proof of a shuffle.

    <li><b>Proofs of shuffles.</b> We use the recent proof of a
      shuffle of Terelius and Wikström, <em>Proofs of Restricted
      Shuffles</em>, Africacrypt 2010, as well as the precomputation
      technique from Wikström, <em>Commitment-Consistent Proofs of
      Shuffles</em>, ACISP 2009.

    <li><b>Verifiable Decryption.</b> We use the batching technique of
      Bellare, Garay, and Rabin, <em>Batch Verification with
      Applications to Cryptography and Checking</em>, LATIN '98, to
      speed up the proofs needed for verifiable decryption.

    <li><b>Overall proof of security.</b> The definition is taken
      from Wikström, <em>A Universally Composable Mix-Net</em>, TCC
      '04, and the analysis is similar to that in Wikström, <em>A
      Sender Verifiable Mix-Net and a New Proof of a Shuffle</em>,
      Asiacrypt '05.

    <li><b>Universal Verifiability.</b> The protocols optionally use
    Fiat-Shamir non-interactive proofs based on SHA-256.

  </ul>
