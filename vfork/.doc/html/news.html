<h2>Changes In Version 1.0.7</h2>
<ul>

  <li> Many small cleanups and corrections of the comments in the
  source.

  <li> Added explicit synchronization step at start of execution. This
  is only to give a nicer impression for the users.

</ul>

<h2>Changes In Version 1.0.6</h2>
<ul>

  <li> The wrappers for Bouncy Castle are removed. There is no need
    for them after elliptic curves have been implemented directly in
    Vfork.

</ul>

<h2>Changes In Version 1.0.5</h2>
<ul>

  <li> Implementation of the provably secure Cramer-Shoup signature
  scheme. This was implemented by Freyr Sævarsson.

  <li> Provably secure collision-resistant hashfunction based on
    Merkle-Damgaard construction on to of Pedersen's hashfunction.

  <li> Pure Java implementation of elliptic curves. The original
    version was implemented by Niko Farhi.

  <li> The above enables the mix-net to be executed
    using <b>exlusively</b> primitives and subprotocols that
    are <b>provably secure</b> assuming that the discrete logarithm
    problem, the decision Diffie-Hellman problem, and the strong RSA
    problems are hard. In particular it uses <b>no random
    oracles</b>. (By default the mix-net still relies on more
    efficient primitives though.)

  <li> Simultaneous and fixed-base exponentiation for the
  abstract <code>PGroupElement</code>.

  <li> Optional native code for elliptic curves, including
  simultaneous and fixed-base exponentiation.

</p>

</ul>

<h2>Changes In Version 1.0.4</h2>
<ul>

  <li> Added options for only mixing (without decrypting) or only
  decrypting (without mixing) to <code>vmn</code>.

  <li> Fixed bug in the building scripts that prevented building the
  documentation from the distributions.

</ul>

<h2>Changes In Version 1.0.3</h2>
<ul>

  <li><b>Important.</b> The command <code>vmn -keygen ...</code> no
  longer dumps the generated public key on standard output. Instead it
  takes an additional parameter specifying the destination file.

  <li> The mix-net interface classes have been reworked. A user can
  now implement its own interface and configure the mix-net to use it
  without editing the code or recompiling.

  <li> Exposed the demo ciphertext generation code as an
  executable <code>vmnd</code>.

  <li> Added option to compute digest of info files directly using
    <code>vmni</code>.

  <li> It is natural to create a directory for a given execution of a
  mix-net and use <code>vmni</code> and <code>vmn</code> within this
  directory. Now there is no need to explicitly give the names of the
  info files when the names of these files can be
  deduced. Use <code>vmni -h</code> and <code>vmn -h</code> for more
  information.

</ul>

<h2>Changes In Version 1.0.2</h2>
<ul>

  <li><b>Important.</b> The format used for the public key exported
  has been simplified.

  <li> The random oracle and the pseudo-random generator based on a
  hashfunction such as SHA-256 has been reworked to not depend on the
  JVM and to be simpler to implement.

  <li> The format used to convert arrays of field elements and group
  elements has been replaced such that it is consistent with
  converting individual elements and forming a larger byte tree.

  <li> Full support for shuffling multiple ciphertexts in parallel.

  <li> A number of bug fixes.

</ul>

<h2>Changes In Version 1.0.1</h2>
<ul>

  <li> Support for any choice of threshold, e.g., one can specify that
  privacy should hold as long as at least 5 out of 7 mix-servers are
  honest. This comes at the price of lack of robustness, i.e., 3
  corrupted mix-servers can halt the execution. Previously only the
  majority threshold was implemented.

  <li> Previous versions used a small number of calls to Unix
  utilities (<code>sort</code>, <code>cp</code>,
  and <code>diff</code>). This dependence has been removed. Thus, it
  can run on Windows or OS X if the shell script wrappers are ported
  to these platforms. All help is welcome!

  <li> Numerous improvements of the build scripts and bug fixes.

  <li> Renamed building scripts from <code>.Makefile_build</code> to
  <code>Makefile.build</code> and similarly the building README files
  from <code>.README</code> to <code>README.build</code>.

</ul>

<h2>Changes In Version 1.0.0</h2>
<ul>

  <li> First version of extensive rewrite of parts of the code.

</ul>

<h2>Changes In Version 0.1.5</h2>
<ul>

  <li> Made it possible to run pure Java code with modular groups.

  <li> Added wrapper classes to use
    the <a href="http://www.bouncycastle.org">Bouncy Castle</a>
    elliptic curve implementations.

  <li> Cleaned up and updated the building scripts.

  <li> Simplified the installation procedure by automating some steps.

  <li> Corrected bugs in the demo scripts.

</ul>

<h2>Changes In Version 0.1.4</h2>
<ul>

  <li> Steve Schneider's group at Surrey University identified a
    serious security flaw in
    <code>vfork.protocol.secretsharing.Pedersen</code>
    and <code>vfork.protocol.secretsharing.PedersenSequential</code>. The
    implemented correction is to use a complete complaint-resolution
    procedure, and not a simplified version with player elimination.

  <li> <code>vfork.protocol.com.SimpleHTTPClient</code> was
    updated to avoid that the adversary can impose long delays without
    detection.

  <li> The JGMPMEE package was reorganized to put all native functions
    in a single final class <code>jgmpmee.GMPMEE</code>.

  <li> Several minor problems in the building and installation process
    were fixed. In particular, the installation problems on 32-bit
    platforms have been identified as a Libtool bug and a manual
    workaround has been documented.

</ul>


<h2>Changes In Version 0.1.2</h2>
<ul>

  <li> The command line tools have been updated such that they no
    longer suffer from the long delays that used to be the case due to
    a sloppy way of fetching precomputed primes.

  <li> The classes for the bulletin board in
    the <code>vfork.protocol.com</code>-package have been partly
    re-organized and cleaned up. This should make it easier to write
    and plug in different implementations of bulletin boards. In the
    next version we hope to have updated <code>Protocol.java</code>
    such that it accepts a choice of bulletin board from the protocol
    info file.
    
  <li> The table of fixed safe prime modulus used
    by <code>ModPGroup</code> has been updated to use "nothing up my
    sleeve"-moduli that are "random looking".

  <li> The class <code>SafePrimePGroup</code> and associated classes
    have been replaced by the more general <code>ModPGroup</code>. The
    latter allows using a subgroup of prime order <i>q</i> of a
    multiplicative group where the prime modulus is of the
    form <i>p=kq+1</i> and <i>k</i> is not 2.

  <li> Hopefully, all of the outdated documentation has been updated
    and all classes completely documented.
    
  <li> The demonstration tools have been improved and extended. They
    now allow orchestrating demonstrations executing on remote
    machines.

  <li> Simplified the installation procedure and added hints for users
    that need help with variables. In the same vein scripts were added
    to <code>make check</code> to verify the environment variables of
    the user and give helpful hints.

</ul>
